problems faced

0. i had to first setup the correct python version to make things work
                
1.dependency conflicts - had too many dependency conflicting the versions on 
    a particular dependency and changing the version alone did not resolve the problem,
    had to remove the version of the conflicting dependency and let pip decide and manage the versions. 
    since crewai had to be maintained at 0.130.0
